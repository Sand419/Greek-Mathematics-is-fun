    </p>
  <h2>Pythagorean Theorom</h2>
    <p style=‘color:green”>This theorom that was used to find the hypotenuse or the slanted side of a right triangle and it was invented by Pythagoras, a Greek mathematician.The formula is a-squared+ b-squared=c-squared. So if  the base of  triangle is 3cm and the height of a triangle is 4. The hypotenuse of a traingle is the square root of 16+9=25 or 5.</p>

    <h2>Euclidean Geometry</h2>
    <p> Euclidean Geometry, is the study of plane and solid figures on the basis of axioms and theorems employed by the Greek mathematician Euclid.</p>

    <p>5 postulates</p>
    <p>1. A <u>straight</u> line segment can be drawn joining any two points.</p>
    <p>2. Any straight line segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line.</p>
    <p>3. Given any straight line segment, a circle can be drawn having the segment as radius and one endpoint as center.</p>
    <p>4. All <strong>right</strong> angles are congruent</p>
    <p>5. If two lines are drawn which intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far enough. This postulate is equivalent to what is known as the parallel postulate.</p>
   <h2 style="color:purple">Method of Exhaustion </h2>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Method_of_exhaustion.jpg"style="width:130px;height:120px">
    <p>The Method of Exhaustion is  a technique that the classical Greek mathematicians used to prove results
      that would now be dealt with by means of limits. It amounts to an early form of integral calculus.</p>
    <h2 style="color:green">Thales' Intercept Theorom</h2>
    <p>Thales  of Miletus established what has become known as Thales' Theorem, whereby if a triangle is drawn within a circle with the long side as a diameter of the circle, then the opposite angle will always be a right angle (as well as some other related properties derived from this). He is also credited with another theorem, also known as Thales' Theorem or the Intercept Theorem, about the ratios of the line segments that are created if two intersecting lines are intercepted by a pair of parallels (and, by extension, the ratios of the sides of similar triangles).</p>

    <h2 style="color:yellow">Diophantus' contribution</h2> 
    <p>Diophantus made a contribution to algebra.Diophantus applied himself to some quite complex algebraic problems, particularly what has since become known as Diophantine Analysis, which deals with finding integer solutions to kinds of problems that lead to equations in several unknowns. Diophantine equations can be defined as polynomial equations with integer coefficients to which only integer solutions are sought. For example, he would explore problems such as: two integers such that the sum of their squares is a square (x2 + y2 = z2, examples being x = 3 and y = 4 giving z = 5, or x = 5 and y =12 giving z = 13); or two integers such that the sum of their cubes is a square (x3 + y3 = z2, a trivial example being x = 1 and y = 2, giving z = 3); or three integers such that their squares are in arithmetic progression (x2 + z2 = 2y2, an example being x = 1, z = 7 and y = 5). His general approach was to determine if a problem has infinitely many, or a finite number of solutions, or none at all.</p>
   <h2 style="color:blue">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, The greeks had made a big contribution to our mathematics today.</p>
